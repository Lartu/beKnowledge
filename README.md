# ðŸ“š beKnowledge
**beKnowledge** is a tool designed to help you read faster by letting you read without moving your eyes.
**beKnowledge** shows you words one after another in the same place at your choosen pace.
It also gives you pauses to blink and a pause every 1000 words so you can rest your eyes and drink a sip of your coffee.

## I don't quite understand
**beKnowledge** is based on the idea behind this gif:

And it turns your texts into that. I've written it to help me study faster and so far it's been a success! (note, it doesn't turn your
text into a gif, it just displays the text in your console the way the gif is displaying it).

## How to compile
To compile beKnowledge you need to have the [LDPL Programming Language compiler](https://github.com/lartu/ldpl) **3.0.4** (or newer) installed
on your $PATH. If you have it, just run

`$ ldpl -i=explode.ldpl beKnowledge.ldpl -o=beKnowledge`

## How to use
Just execute **beKnowledge** with your favorite text file like this:

`$ ./beKnowledge <yourfile.txt>`

Replacing `<yourfile.txt>` by the name of your actual text file.

## Download an executable

Executables are provided for **Linux x64** in the releases section of this repository.
